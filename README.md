This project is meant to support an ongoing research program on False Bay, dedicated to the design of future water lines for coastal management and planning. The first component is the collation, organization and reprocessing of existing wave and current data collected in False Bay since 2010. This involves identifying open-source software that can process data from a Teledyne RDI Sentinel ADCP. The second component is to compare the existing data to the known circulation features and published modelling studies.
