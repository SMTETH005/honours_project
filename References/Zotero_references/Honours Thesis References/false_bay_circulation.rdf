The development of this cyclonic pattern is primarily caused by the spatially varying wind field. During warmer months, upwelling events were noted at Cape Hangklip. Interestingly, under northwesterly wind conditions, the model results deviated from historical findings by showing a spatially uniform current field across the bay. Under these conditions, strong bottom return currents are generated, which contribute significantly to cold-water intrusion events within the bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FMC5VV3ZE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2295%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman et al., 2021, p. 95&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

However, the minor axis of the measurements was aligned at 90° to the major axis, whereas the minor axis of the model results was aligned with the major axis.

More specifically, surface flows tended to be wind-driven, with bottom flows comprising weak (≤0.1 m s −1) tide-driven currents. This finding is consistent with Gründlingh et al. (1989) who reported measured tidal bottom-current speeds of 0.09–0.11 m s−1 at the entrance of the bay. Similarly, Wainman et al. (1987) measured tidal bottom currents at Cape Point within the range of 0.0–0.2 m s−1, which are consistent with our model results.

&lt;p&gt;This is subinertial I think. The south easterly wind varies at a frequency which is lower than the inertial period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very cool result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under the southeasterly wind conditions, the model results also showed the formation of a weak anticyclonic gyre near Gordons Bay. This zone showed evidence of a ‘wind shadow’ that stretched from Strand along the eastern shore up to Cape Hangklip. The presence of a wind shadow under southeasterly conditions was documented by Wainman et al. (1987). The current magnitudes in this region are typically ≤0.1 m s−1 at the surface and ≤0.05 m s−1 near the seabed. Model results correctly reproduced the decoupling of surface and bottom flows, which was noted in previous studies (Gründlingh and Potgieter 1993; Taljaard et al. 2000; Nicholson, 2011). Decoupling of flows refers to surface flows being significantly influenced by wind forcing, in comparison to weaker bottom flows which move in a different direction. While the surface flow formed a stronger clockwise (or cyclonic) gyre, the bottom flows showed a weaker cyclonic flow. Surface current magnitudes of up to 0.3 m s−1 were generated under the influence of strong southeasterly winds (approximately 12 m s−1). Bottom current magnitudes were weak, with magnitudes of 0.05–0.1 m s−1.” &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FMC5VV3ZE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22109%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman et al., 2021, p. 109&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

During the shallow southeasterly regime, the wind cannot rise above the Kogelberg Mountain range (peak at 1 261 m above sea level) because of the presence of a shallow (~600 m) inversion layer (Jury 1987, cited in Pfaff et al. 2019). Hence the winds are deflected around Cape Hangklip and a wind shadow occurs along the eastern shore of the bay. During the deep southeasterly as well as the deep northwesterly wind regimes, when the inversion layer is higher than the mountain ranges, the winds can flow over the Kogelberg Mountain range and the Table Mountain range, respectively, falling onto the bay without significant wind shadow areas forming along either side of the bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FMC5VV3ZE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22115%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman et al., 2021, p. 115&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Simulating the Coastal Ocean Circulation Near the Cape Peninsula Using a Coupled Numerical Model</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A coupled numerical hydrodynamic model is presented for the Cape Peninsula region of South Africa. The model is intended to support a range of interdisciplinary coastal management and research applications, given the multifaceted socio-economic and ecological value of the study area. Calibration and validation are presented, with the model reproducing the mean circulation well. Maximum differences between modelled and measured mean surface current speeds and directions of 3.9 × 10−2 m s−1 and 20.7°, respectively, were produced near Cape Town, where current velocities are moderate. At other measurement sites, the model closely reproduces mean surface and near-bed current speeds and directions and outperforms a global model. In simulating sub-daily velocity variability, the model’s skill is moderate, and similar to that of a global model, where comparison is possible. It offers the distinct advantage of producing information where the global model cannot, however. Validation for temperature and salinity is provided, indicating promising performance. The model produces a range of expected dynamical features for the domain including upwelling and vertical current shear. Nuances in circulation patterns are revealed; specifically, the development of rotational flow patterns within False Bay is qualified and an eddy in Table Bay is identified.</dcterms:abstract>

In summer, the south-Atlantic anticyclone is situated west of southern Africa, giving rise to frequent, strong south-easterly winds over Cape Town. In winter, the south-Atlantic anticyclone migrates northwards, allowing transient midlatitude cyclones and coastal low pressures to brush the domain, bringing northwesterly and westerly winds following the passing of low-pressure systems and ahead of cold fronts. These north-westerly and westerly winds dominate during colder months, though to a lesser extent than the south-easterly winds during summer, which occur even during colder months [18–20]. After a cold front has passed, south-westerly winds are possible as a high-pressure system ridges towards the study domain [20].”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F4E2Y7VTV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Vos et al., 2021, p. 2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

[33]. Wind forcing (responsible for the first two patterns described below) is clearly dominant in False Bay with tidal and inertial currents being of secondary importance, particularly during times of weak winds [8,21,33–35]. The first of these is a clockwise rotation, observed mostly during summer and driven by the frequent south-easterly winds. This pattern was further observed by Ref. [35], and modelled by Ref. [22]. The circulation within the Bay under these conditions is partially set up by west-north-westerly flow south of the Bay splitting at Cape Point, with the northerly arm then establishing equatorward flow along the western shores [8,18,33]. The frequency of south-easterly winds results in this clockwise regime dominating [33,35]. Ref. [35] qualified this pattern by noting poleward motion at Cape Point, which prevented true cyclonic motion over the whole Bay. The second is an anti-clockwise rotation in response to north-westerly winds, with an eastwards current flowing south of the Bay entering at Cape Hangklip [9,33,35]. The third and fourth patterns arise from tidal forcing during outgoing and incoming tides respectively. They are permitted to develop in the absence of strong wind forcing [8,33], with fairly uniform northward flow during incoming tides, southward flow during outgoing tides, and bathymetric steering in shallow regions. Ref. [35] found tides to generate currents along the perimeter of the Bay and in the shallowing northern reaches between Simonstown and Gordon’s Bay. At the mouth of the Bay, tidal and inertial currents appeared to be regular contributors to the overall variability in the lower half of the water column (along with the familiar meteorological periodicity evident in the wind-driven variability) [8]. Energy from surface gravity waves and focused by bathymetry immediately outside and within the Bay are important drivers of currents in the nearshore, particularly in the northern reaches density dynamics in the Bay are predominantly temperature controlled, with only weak contributions from salinity [37]. Temperature is affected by wind via upwelling and advection of cold water, with insolation playing a secondary role, especially in the northerly and north-easterly shallows [8,34,35,37]. Ref. [38], however, determined waves to control nearshore temperatures to a greater degree than wind. The most notable thermal feature is upwelling of cold water north-west of Hangklip, and to a lesser extent, Gordon’s Bay, in response to strong south-easterly winds [22,34,35,37]. Upwelling was also observed along the coastal stretch up to 20 km east of Hangklip, in turn supplying cold water to both Hangklip and the interior of the Bay [18,37]. The Bay is generally thermally stratified in summer, with a well-developed thermocline and relatively higher vertical temperature variability.

Sea-level pressure (SLP) signals were reproduced faithfully, albeit that the ERA-I product exhibited a very slight positive bias in all cases (Figure S1). While the 10 m wind velocity signals were reasonably well simulated, there are times during which errors (particularly in direction) are noticeable (Figure S2). This is likely due to sub-grid scale effects such as sheltering and deflection due to mountains.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F4E2Y7VTV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Vos et al., 2021, p. 9&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Bottom flows (now southwestward except in the shallow, nearshore band) between Oudekraal and Olifantsbos are nearly opposed to surface flows (now south and south-eastward).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F4E2Y7VTV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Vos et al., 2021, p. 17&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An example of the anticyclonic rotation observed in the literature is shown in Figure 12, having developed during northerly wind conditions on the morning of 14 August 2006. This rotation is weak, with flows barely exceeding 0.3 m s−1 near Cape Point and remaining below 0.2 m s−1 across the rest of the Bay. Poleward flow developing offshore of Kogelbaai and extending along the southeastern margins prevents the completion of the pattern; however. Flow is directionally similar throughout the vertical column. Figure 13 shows southward and south-eastward surface flow (aligned with the wind) having developed during a different north-westerly wind event. Weak north-westward bottom return flows occur, and no noticeable gyrecirculation develops. In such cases, there is no dominant depth-integrated pattern, given the vertical shear.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F4E2Y7VTV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Vos et al., 2021, p. 17&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The expectation of cyclonic flow in False Bay during south-easterly winds is also qualified. First, cyclonic flow does not always develop during south-easterly winds. Second, it is more likely to be permitted when the wind shadow near Gordon’s Bay is in effect. Third, when this wind shadow breaks down, an anticyclonic rotation, induced by strong westward flow along the north-eastern reaches, is established.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F4E2Y7VTV%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2224%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Vos et al., 2021, p. 24&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Bottom currents at the entrance to False Bay, South Africa</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>False Bay, the biggest bay in South Africa, has to accommodate various demands in terms of recreation, naval activities and fisheries while it is lately also exposed to increased pollution. To determine the currents at the entrance to the Bay and thus obtain insight into the dynamics of the region, the flushing rate of the Bay and other aspects of the circulation, a number of current meters were deployed in the lower half of the water column at the entrance during the austral summer of 1986/1987. The results of these measurements, augmented and supported by temperature-salinity sections and meteorologic measurements in the vicinity, are discussed and compared with historical observations of the currents and water properties in the Bay.</dcterms:abstract>

The synoptic systems originate mainly from movements of atmospheric Rossby waves and associated fronts over the Southern Ocean that are guided northeastward to the subcontinent by the South Atlantic High (SAH). Winds blowing offshore during the approach of a front from the west or southwest generate coastal lows along the south or west coasts of South Africa and these propagate as trapped atmospheric waves anticlockwise around the coast (GILL, 1977).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FJJV4REIQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221030%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Gründlingh et al., 1989, p. 1030&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Comparing this result with the average flow at mooring A gives the impression of a divergence of the flow field, probably due to the presence of Cape Point. This confirms the postulation of ATKINS (1970a) that Cape Point may be a separation point where flow from the southeast (under southeasterly wind conditions) is bifurcated, the deflected northern branch giving rise to the clockwise circulation previously observed in the Bay. A simplified portrayal of the flow is given in Fig. 7. The results (especially those at mooring A) do not convey any information whether the 'coastal poleward current&quot; flowing southward along the west coast (NELSONand POLITO, 1987), can enter False Bay. The northward flow at mooring A could obviously entrain water originating from this current and thus introduce colder water to the Bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FJJV4REIQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221038%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Gründlingh et al., 1989, p. 1038&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On average this tide was more significant in the V component, increasing slightly in magnitude from west to east. Only at mooring B was there a significant signal in the U component as well.

Surprisingly, these signals were virtually absent from the V component of meter A1, a feature that cannot be explained. The clarity of the inertial signal suggested that the inertial modulation of the steady-state flow is quite pronounced much of the time. This was also evident from visual inspection of the time series. It points to the presence of (wind-driven?) steady flow conditions, in conjunction with low-frequency variation of the cyclonic character of the flow (Fig. 6).

&lt;p&gt;Inertial modulation of steady-state flow? I will need to do some more reading on this topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From what I gather the steady-state flow (volume in = volume out) is affected by inertial forces. This likely generates eddies and filaments in the currents.&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, the semidiurnal tide was mainly in a north-northeast to south-southwest direction (i.e. mainly in/out of the Bay) at 2.6-3.8 cm s-1. Although the signals are all of comparable magnitude, it was unforeseen that the diurnal and semidiurnal oscillations were almost at right angles to each other.

The periods of the surface seiches would have been too short to capture with the current meters but internal seiches would be much longer (about 38-44 h, depending on the density stratification at the time). Correction for the entrance effect (DEFANT, 1961, p. 174) could lengthen the period to 52-60 h. The maximum velocity involved in an internal seiche is in the order of 1 cm s-I, which is well below the threshold velocity of the current meters.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FJJV4REIQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221040%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Gründlingh et al., 1989, p. 1040&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some good reading on internal seiches in lakes. It is a standing wave that is typically formed due to wind forcing. The water is tilted and gravity then acts to make the surface of the water horizontal again. This causes the water to &quot;slosh&quot; in the form of a standing wave, with multiple nodes and antinodes throughout (complicated).&lt;/p&gt;

This points toward a single generating mechanism that would have operated fairly simultaneously at all moorings. The time delay between the occurrence of the anomaly off Cape Point and Cape Hangklip ( - 5 h) is then slightly enigmatic. However, inspection of data from meteorologic sensors at Cape Hangklip and Seal Island (from a different experiment, VAN NIEKERKand BOTES, personal communication) revealed (surprisingly) that a time delay of 6 h between wind peaks recorded at different locations around the Bay is quite common. It was taken as final confirmation that the wind action was the main generator of the observed internal tide.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FJJV4REIQ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221047%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Gründlingh et al., 1989, p. 1047&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Winds and subsurface currents in the False Bay region, South Africa</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Four current-meter moorings placed in False Bay between February and May 1985 revealed a tendency towards cyclonic motion, but with poleward flow along the western boundary. Data from six anemometers situated around the Bay showed periodic acceleration of northward air flow associated with south-easterly wind events during ridging of the South Atlantic high pressure cell round the continent. A clear pattern of cooling and warming of water at the current-meter sites was observed, corresponding to the acceleration and decay phases of south-easterly wind over periods of a few days. There was a suggestion of subsidence of warm water along the western boundary when the wind relaxed.</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;polar density plot - summarises the frequency and speed of current directions. The angle is the direction the current is going toward (there is a strong north and south component). The radius is the current speed. The contours connect regions of equal frequency/probability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is strong directionality present: the contours are elongated along a principal axis (30 to 210) which indicates that the current mostly oscillated along this line (bimodal distribution = oscillatory flow).&lt;/p&gt;

The result of this exercise yields periodicities of 2,8, 2,7 and 3, I days at the three sites.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F5M8FDETE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22344%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Wainman et al., 1987, p. 344&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the oscillatory motion along the principal axis is not attributed to tidal periods (shorter than 24 hours).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oscillatory motion arises from supratidal periods (longer than 24 hours). A single periodicity is not dominant. This implies that something else is forcing it - likely the synoptic wind, ridging south Atlantic high.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Coastal gradients in False Bay, south of Cape Town: what insights can be gained from mesoscale reanalysis?</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Mesoscale datasets are used to study coastal gradients in the marine climate and oceanography in False Bay, south of Cape Town. Building on past work, satellite and ocean–atmosphere reanalyses are used to gain new insights into the mean structure, circulation and meteorological features. HYCOM v3 hindcasts represent a coastward reduction of mixing that enhances stratification and productivity inshore. The mean summer currents are westward 0.4 m s−1 along the shelf edge and weakly clockwise within False Bay. The marine climate is dominated by southeasterly winds that accelerate over the mountains south of Cape Town and fan out producing dry weather. Virtual buoy time series in December 2012–February 2013 exhibit weather-pulsed upwelling in early summer interspersed with quiescent spells in late summer. Intercomparisons between model, satellite and station data build confidence that coupled reanalyses yield opportunities to study air–sea interactions in coastal zones with complex topography. The 0.083∘ HYCOM reanalysis has 16 data points in False Bay, just adequate to resolve the coastal gradient and its impacts on ocean productivity.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Sedimentology of False Bay (Western Cape, South Africa): geological background information for the integrated environmental management of a physically confined coastal compartment</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>False Bay is a large, physically confined embayment located along the southwest coast of South Africa. It is a classic example of a coastal compartment or littoral cell that acts as a receptor and sink of both terrestrial (siliciclastic) and marine (bioclastic) material. It is almost square in shape, measuring ∼35 km N-S and ∼39 km W-E and covering ∼1130 km2. Only a few small rivers discharge into the bay, as a consequence of which only small amounts of sediment are episodically supplied to the bay. The bathymetry reveals two well-defined terraces, one between 30 and 45 m, the other between 50 and 55 m water depth, which are indicative of extended Pleistocene sea-level stillstands. Sediment is dispersed by long-period ocean swells approaching from the southwestern quadrant, as well as nearshore swell- and wind-driven currents. The presence of a prominent rock pinnacle at the entrance to the bay (Rocky Bank) causes wave orthogonals to converge on its leeward side, and which results in substantial wave amplification along the eastern shore of the bay. Coarse-grained sediments (gravel, very coarse sand, coarse sand and medium sand) line the rocky shores in the west and east, and are dispersed around and away from submarine rock outcrops, whereas fine-grained sediments (fine sand, very fine sand and mud) are largely confined to an arcuate belt extending along the centre of the bay from shallow water in the northwest to the deepest parts in the south. This is documented by the distribution of individual size fractions and the mean grain size, and applies to both the siliciclastic and the bioclastic sediment components which appear to be in hydraulic equilibrium. There is a distinct N-S gradient from lower to higher bioclastic content with increasing water depth. The textural parameters (mean grain size, sorting and skewness) reveal the existence of two hydraulic populations that are mixed in various proportions in the course of their dispersal in the form of either bed load or suspended load transport. The mud fraction is closely linked to the dispersal pattern of the fine and very fine sand fractions, indicating that it is transported in the form of aggregates and/or faecal pellets, the bulk of which is evidently in hydraulic equilibrium with the finer-grained sands. It can be anticipated that, during lower Pleistocene sea levels, the palaeo-False Bay valley was occupied, or at least regularly visited, by large and small African mammals and early humans.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A new model-based coastal retention index (CORE) identifies bays as hotspots of retention, biological production and cumulative anthropogenic pressures</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Retention is a key driver of biological productivity near the coast since increased concentrations of planktonic particles in retention hotspots boost local primary production, availability of particulate food and larval recruitment. Known retention sites, such as bays, are also places where anthropogenic pressures accumulate in the form of pollution, harmful algal blooms, fisheries, aquaculture and port developments. In the face of these growing hazards, South African bays were recently declared ‘threatened’ priority sites for enhanced conservation and marine spatial planning (MSP). Multidisciplinary studies that spatially relate human impacts to physical features (such as retention patterns) and ecological processes (such as primary production) are valuable in this context. This study made use of a high resolution CROCO (Coastal and Regional Ocean Community Model) model along with the Parcels particle-tracking tool to develop a spatio-temporal coastal retention index (CORE) for the South African coastal ocean. To explore links between retention, biological productivity and anthropogenic impacts, a monthly time series of CORE (2001–2012) was evaluated in relation to satellite-derived coastal chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and an index of cumulative human pressure. CORE showed variable temporal relationships with Chl-a among different subregions, however, when integrated over time, their spatial trends and peaks commonly aligned. This was most obvious on the south coast, where retention, Chl-a and human pressures peaked in the majority of bays that characterise this region. In the case of St Helena Bay on the west coast, CORE failed to represent a prominent retentive feature associated with upwelling, due to rapid alongshore advection of particles outside the 25-km retention radius of CORE. Despite this limitation, CORE provided profound insight into the variability of the coastal circulation around South Africa and its coupling with other socio-ecological variables. By contributing a novel data layer for MSP, CORE assists the integrated coastal management of bay ecosystems that face the hazards of multiple destructive uses.</dcterms:abstract>

Here retention was strongly coupled with Chl-a. The highest Chl-a concentrations occurred in autumn, which is the time of year when high biomass (&amp;gt;30 mg m 3) and potentially harmful dinoflagellate blooms are known to occur in the region (Pitcher and Pillar, 2010; Pitcher et al., 2008). Pitcher and Pillar (2010) noted that both False Bay and Walker Bay are also sites of bloom accumulation through physical processes like enrichment of nutrients by upwelling and retentive circulation patterns. The extremely high retention in False Bay is likely due to its square shape, and the fact that the western (downstream) headland traps westward currents in a recirculation pattern during upwelling, when the bay is also isolated from the open ocean by an upwelling plume (Largier, 2020). Historic observations and model results (Nicholson, 2012) indicate that the circulation tends to be cyclonic in nature, particularly under upwelling favourable conditions in summer (Pitcher et al., 2010). A semi-permanent anticyclonic eddy is situated in the northeastern corner of the bay near Gordon’s Bay (Grindley et al., 1964), enhancing retention and vulnerability to poor water quality and HABs (Pitcher and Pillar, 2010). Very little information is available on the more exposed Walker Bay, but model results (not shown) suggest that it offers shelter from an intense northwestward jet that crosses its mouth as well as the mouth of the adjacent False Bay during summer upwelling favourable months.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FWN4CALA6%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Pfaff et al., 2022, p. 10&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical retention mechanisms combined with nutrient enrichment create a highly productive, retentive environment in False Bay during summer upwelling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Modelling waves and near-shore circulation around the Cape Peninsula: towards enhanced predictions for South African coastal activities</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>South Africa's coastal oceans support a multitude of human and ecological interests. My work at the confluence of academia, industry and government highlighted a gap in knowledge and capacity in the marine environmental information space. Broad research questions were developed and addressed through a combination of statistical review, data mining and numerical modelling: how do marine weather and oceanography impinge on South African coastal activities, what are the main circulation characteristics in a critical coastal region, and which environmental data are needed for predictions? Hazard modelling of environmental conditions and coastal user safety in South Africa revealed a wide sensitivity to weather-ocean hazards among different users and places. The Cape Peninsula sub-region exhibited the highest incident frequency related to increasing hazard severity. I implemented a coupled numerical ocean model (Delft3D FLOW and SWAN), with 700 m horizontal resolution to simulate waves and currents in this area. The model is driven by realistic forcing, striking a previously lacking balance between geographical coverage, spatial granularity, and process complexity. It has the potential to be deployed in forecast mode in future. Modelling confirmed the importance of wind in establishing broad circulation patterns and inducing nearshore upwelling. However, bay-scale cyclonic and anticyclonic flow in False Bay has low-medium predictability. These patterns developed as expected at times but failed to do so at others. The model's inclusion of two-way wave-current interactions enabled the identification of a novel cyclonic gyre in Table Bay during large wave events. Investigation revealed the gyre to be driven by wave induced radiation stress gradients. Model experiments with and without wave-coupling demonstrated that the gyre causes material differences in virtual drift trajectories and affects the monthly mean general circulation. This highlights its potential impact on coastal users and its implications for understanding Table Bay's circulation, where the importance of waves beyond the nearshore may be crucial for predictability. Enhanced velocity measurements, sufficient to resolve the alternating rotational circulation in False Bay and wave-driven gyre in Table Bay, are recommended. It is further suggested that appropriate wave forcing be included in any further circulation modelling in the study area.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Development and Validation of a Hydrodynamic Model of False Bay</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>False Bay is located in the Western Cape and is the largest coastal embayment along the South African coastline. The location of the bay is unique in that it is influenced by a complex wind regime and by both the Benguela and Agulhas currents. In recent years, False Bay has become the focus of numerous studies investigating engineering and environmental issues such as water quality issues, storm events, wave focusing and rip currents at certain beaches. In order to understand and assess these issues, physical processes, such as coastal hydrodynamics, within False Bay needs to be well defined.</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting. Does a spatially-uniform current field across the entire bay sound realistic? I doubt it, but maybe it is possible under these conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if the under current is visible in the data?&lt;/p&gt;

This feature segregates warmer western and colder eastern waters. Due to the asymmetry of bathymetry at the entrance, bottom waters are approximately 1-2°C colder east of Rocky Bank under well-mixed (isothermic) and stratified conditions. In warmer months, under stratified conditions, the northwesterly winds significantly contribute to stratification in the bay due to cold water advection from offshore to the middle of the bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22-%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, pp. -&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, a major limitation of these models is insufficient calibration and verification against measurement data. In addition, spatially varying wind forcing has not been considered in these studies which has been regarded as a serious hindrance in providing robust simulation of the hydrodynamics of False Bay (Taljaard et al., 2000). Therefore, the current study is one of the first studies to investigate the influence of spatially varying wind forcing on the coastal hydrodynamics of False Bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 3&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, more temperature and salinity variation is present than along an open coast. Furthermore, the complex mountainous topography surrounding False Bay results in a complex wind field that contributes to complex hydrodynamic behaviour within the bay such as seasonal upwelling. Moreover, the geographic position of the bay is in a rare location that is significantly influenced by both the warm Agulhas current and the cold Benguela current. The interaction of these two currents further adds to the complexity of the hydrodynamics within False Bay. This hydrodynamic interaction and the complex wind-induced upwelling, has resulted in False Bay being the focus of a number of studies over the last four decades (Cram, (1970); Atkins, (1970a); Shannon et al,. (1983); Jury, (1985); Jury, (1986); Botes, (1988); Gründlingh et al., (1989); Gründlingh &amp;amp; Largier, (1991); Gründlingh &amp;amp; Potgieter, (1993); Nicholson, (2011); Dufois et al., (2012)).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 5&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The study involved the set-up of a hydrodynamic model of False Bay with the aim of forming a comparative analysis of a (1) “constant bathymetry scenario”, which assumed an average depth of -50 m MSL across the entire domain, with a (2) “realistic bathymetry” scenario, which considered the actual bathymetry of False Bay. The results of the comparative analysis showed that the there was an apparent “seasonal decoupling” in the realistic bathymetry scenario i.e. the surface currents and bottom currents behaved independently of one another in summer months. This phenomenon was determined to be partly due to the influence of the unique bathymetry of False Bay. More specifically, shallow regions within the bay, such as Rocky Bank, contribute significantly to the flow regime and therefore the thermal structure, seasonal stratification and circulation in the bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 7&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

This seasonality in wind conditions is due to major atmospheric pressure systems which move northwards in winter meaning that the predominant wind conditions change from the typical south-to-south east winds associated with the South Atlantic high-pressure system, to north-to-north west associated with the mid-latitude cyclones and coastal lows (Taljaard et al., 2000). 2.1.3 Wave Climate Wave conditions significantly influence sediment transport within the bay primarily due to turbulence and the generation of longshore currents around the periphery of the bay. The wave interaction with Rocky Bank has been the focus of a few studies, particularly the focusing of waves between the Steenbras River mouth and Cape Hangklip (Taljaard et al., 2000). This focusing is prevalent during the refraction of south westerly swells into the bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 7&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is believed that the south-easterly circulation pattern persists under calm and weaker north-westerly wind conditions; and ▪ North-westerly wind generated: surface and bottom currents are generated in an anticyclonic motion with a small cyclonic gyre formed near Gordons Bay. It should be noted that the correlation between current circulation and north-westerly winds is believed to be weaker than south-easterly generated circulation patterns (Taljaard et al., 2000).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 17&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok this makes more sense now. If I recall from the paper on coastal erosion. Westward current longshore during summer, so when the south-easterlies blow. This is replaced by a eastward current during winter. I think it is likely due to the incoming swell direction (angle at which the waves hit the shore, rather than the wind forcing)&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, the bifurcated circulation pattern (refer to Figure 2-8) postulated by Gründlingh et al. (1989) is well represented in Figure 6-6. The formation of this gyre means that there is a net inflow near Cape Point and net outflow at Cape Hangklip. From analysis of the south-easterly circulation pattern presented in Figure 6-8, colder surface waters are advected from offshore through the entrance of the bay at Cape Point toward the middle of the bay. The cyclonic circulation pattern results in warmer nearshore water being advected through the entrance (near Cape Hangklip) toward offshore. However, the results indicated that this circulation pattern is generally fully developed under stronger south-easterly conditions.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2264%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 64&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Instead, the north-westerly wind condition induces a spatially-uniform current field with no distinct gyres forming in the bay. A possible explanation for this finding could be the formation of the northwesterly wind condition which is less spatially-complex than the south-easterly wind condition. Unlike south-easterly winds which are influenced by complex orographic features surrounding False Bay, north-westerly winds are mainly influenced by Table Mountain (Jury, 1984) which is further from the bay. North westerly winds tend to deflect around Table Mountain and across the bay uniformly until they are steered westerly at the entrance of the bay at Cape Point and Cape Hangklip (refer to Figure 2-6).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FXANXBICE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2270%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Coleman, 2019, p. 70&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>On the importance of wind generated waves in embayments with complex orographic features – A South African case study</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The current study explores the importance of local ocean-atmosphere interactions in modelling wave records in embayments surrounded by significant orographic features and semi-sheltered against swell waves. The numerical code Simulating WAves in the Nearshore (SWAN) was employed for this purpose. False Bay and Table Bay, both located adjacent to the Cape Peninsula in South Africa, were used as case studies due to their geographical location and significance at the southern tip of Africa, their proximity to each other and their surrounding orography. Various combinations of atmospheric forcing were investigated (e.g. various atmospheric forcing horizontal resolutions) to distill the importance of remotely originating swell and locally generated wind waves on both peripheries of False Bay and within Table Bay. Generally, both embayments require high resolution, spatially varying wind forcing to capture the effects of the complex orography. The waves on the western periphery of False Bay and Table Bay are mainly generated by local spatially varying winds, while the waves on the eastern periphery of False Bay are mainly the incoming swell. Results are presented via statistical correlations with measured data, time-series comparisons, wind roses and wave field difference plots.</dcterms:abstract>

As the swell enters the mouth of False Bay the waves are influenced by a shallow patch (‘Rocky Bank”) (refer to Fig. 2 and denoted as RB) (Salonen, 2019; Shipley, 1964). Swell entering Table Bay is influenced by the northern extent of the Cape Peninsula enclosing Table Bay. Inside False Bay, the bathymetry is steep on the western and eastern peripheries while the northern periphery is gentle sloping as given in Fig. 2. The eastern periphery of False Bay is more exposed and leads to larger waves. The western periphery of False Bay and Table Bay are exposed to lower wave heights due to the sheltering of the predominant south-westerly swell by the peninsula, also given in Fig. 5(a). In general, very little research has been done to understand the physical wave and oceanographic dynamics of False Bay and Table Bay.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FDRCJJ7Y7%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%225%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Daniels et al., 2022, p. 5&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Model M1 performs better than M2 and M3 on the western side of the bay, indicating that spatially varying winds are needed to force a wave model in the region. The high-resolution computation of M1 achieves the best statistics and therefore this output has the best agreement with measurements at ST. Analysis of model output on the eastern periphery of False Bay in Section 4.2 indicate that M1 and M3 better simulate the waves records. M3 performs better than M1, indicating that the waves on the eastern periphery of False Bay are mainly generated by incoming swell, while local wind forcing cannot be neglected as revealed by the statistics for M1. The performance of the models in Table Bay indicate that the waves are generated by local and remote wind forcing as M1 and M2 performs better than M3.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FDRCJJ7Y7%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Daniels et al., 2022, p. 16&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under SW swell conditions, the waves on the western side of FB are generated by local wind forcing (primarily). Spatially varying winds are required to force a wave model in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The waves on the eastern side of FB are mainly generated by incoming swell, but wind forcing cannot be neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Agulhas current follows the shelf nicely, but the S + N Benguela and southern current systems are more complicated because they are not bound by a narrow deep shelf. The shelf is wide and shallow, which together with its orientation (wrt the rotation of the earth), has a profound effect on the circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Toward nearshore, bathymetry induced wave amplification in False Bay, South Africa</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A seamount called Rocky Bank (RB) has been suspected to spatially focus wave energy toward the eastern periphery of False Bay, South Africa, where it is not uncommon for fishermen to get washed off by waves. Situated at the bay’s mouth, the submerged seamount acts like a refracting lens for incoming long-crested swell. The present study aims at understanding the wave transformation effects of RB and the nearshore bathymetry using the phase-averaging spectral wave model simulating waves in the nearshore. Open ocean conditions around the Cape Peninsula, derived from National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis products, were used as model boundary conditions. To establish RB’s influence, a bathymetry without RB was created. The model output indicated that coastal significant wave heights were 9% greater when RB was removed. This difference was largest for smaller incident significant wave height and increasing incident peak period. RB also causes wave convergence via refraction and presents evidence for spatial focusing, a coincidental interference, extreme wave generating mechanism. This result, together with recorded incidents and anecdotal evidence, suggests that the wave transformation effects of RB may be leading to extreme waves along the eastern periphery. Evidence for spatial focusing toward the eastern periphery occurred for peak wave directions between 210○ and 245○ true north and for peak periods greater than 13 s. The likelihood of a wave leading to an incident is greater in smaller, long-crested seas based on the recent literature for the region. To extend this study to predict rogue wave events within False Bay, a phase-resolving model would be required.</dcterms:abstract>

This study showed that peak wave periods (Tp) upward from 13 s will cause refractive focusing [for all of the simulated incident wave directions (θp)]. The wave transformation is characterized by wave shoaling over Rocky Bank, a reduction in wave heights in the lee of Rocky Bank (Hm0_coast) and converging wave energy due to wave refraction caused by Rocky Bank. The wave refraction highlighted by SWAN’s phase-averaged output suggests that spatial (or refractive) focusing does occur in False Bay, a known mechanism for extreme wave formation.8,10,16”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FCCFMG7UJ%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Salonen and Rautenbach, 2021, p. 2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dcterms:abstract>Numerous studies in sexual selection have been interpreted as showing that components of the signalling system involved in mating are under strong directional selection due to female preferences for elaborate traits. Conversely, the recognition concept of species predicts strong stabilizing selection on the specific-mate recognition system. We document directional preferences in a population of the African painted reedfrog, Hyperolius mannoratus, in two-choice phonotaxis experiments, utilizing synthesized calls. Females failed to respond consistently to population mean values of specific-mate recognition system signal components in choice experiments presenting mean and extreme value stimuli. Even the least-preferred extremes of coupled signal components were still effective in eliciting phonotactic responses. Our results provide no evidence for stabilizing selection within the tested range.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The Bathymetry and Microrelief of False Bay</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The paper describes the shape, dimensions and coastline of False Bay and gives the source and accuracy of the data from which a chart was drawn to establish the morphology of the sea-bed of the bay. It goes on to describe the various outstanding features of the bottom, pointing out the overall evenness of the gradients in a N/S direction and the difference in the microrelief between the western and eastern sides. The western side is studded with isolated boulders or rocky outcrops whilst on the eastern are a number of ridges running in a N/S direction. More detailed sounding data are required to give a full interpretation of the microrelief in the northern and eastern areas.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The influence of wave action on coastal erosion along Monwabisi Beach, Cape Town</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The coastline to the east of the Monwabisi Beach tidal pool has been subject to substantial visible coastal erosion. Monwabisi is located near the City of Cape Town and is situated along the northern coastline of False Bay. The erosion that has occurred has raised concern as it is damaging local infrastructure. The coastline retreat to the east of Monwabisi was investigated through analysis of aerial photographs and wave data to establish whether there is a relationship between dynamic wave action that this bay is subjected to, and the observed erosion within the study area. The maximum lateral coastal erosion at the Monwabisi study area from 2003 until 2014 was approximately 30m in a landward direction. Based on the correlation of the results between the rate of coastline retreat and the wave data, the study has concluded that the extreme rates of coastline retreat experienced within the study area at Monwabisi is most likely a direct result of a combination of influences including the number and height of big wave events, waves coming from a more southerly direction, the underlying geological substrate of the study area, and the impact that the local infrastructure has had on the geological substrate. Three time periods of maximum monthly erosion rates occurred from June 2008 to November 2009, March 2010 to March 2011 and April 2011 to June 2012.</dcterms:abstract>

A quantification of the risks associated with coastal erosion along the South African coast is essential when considering that over 40% of South Africans reside within 100km of the coastline and could be affected by future sea-level rise (SLR)induced erosion (Unterner et al. 2011) and many of these areas are undergoing massive urban and population expansion (Theron et al. 2010). Waves, tides and SLR are the main contributors to coastal erosion and damage to local infrastructure in South Africa, especially when high intensity storms occur alongside high tides (Theron et al. 2010).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKZ6ZM2G7%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2297%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fourie et al., 2015, p. 97&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Winds and Current Patterns in False Bay</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Wind records from six reporting stations in the vicinity of False Bay have been analysed, and the mean directional frequency and velocity combined to give relative ‘wind run’ for each station and season are shown in the form of wind roses. Methods of current measurements are briefly discussed, and the ‘dye-bomb’ technique using aircraft chosen to obtain a nearly synoptic pattern over a wide area. The results of thirteen such operations at eleven selected stations have indicated that four main patterns have evolved, the predominant type being a clockwise rotation. Fifteen further operations close to the west, north and north-east shores were later carried out and the results are shown in current roses for each station for winter and summer conditions.</dcterms:abstract>

The current then is deflected into False Bay either by the angle of approach or by the prevailing southeast winds at Cape Point. The subsequentpattern is often determined by the direction of entry of the current into the bay, and it will be seen that gyres occur in the Gordon’s Bay area which are frequently in the reverse direction. The example of Type I1 occurred after a strong north-west wind in February, probably west seawards of Cape Point and an east-flowing current entered at Cape Hangklip. During the summer the water is thermally stable, and it is surmised that currents maintain their momentum by being limited to relatively shallow depths and thus follow the steep coastal contours on the coast, until influenced by local winds in the Bay. Types I11 and IV occurred after a period of calms and their slow-movingcurrents appear to coincide with tidal conditions. In this connection attempts at calculating tidal current speeds have been made by two methods: ( I ) increase in volume due to tidal rise divided by the cross-sectionalarea, and (2)assuming a standing wave condition in a rectangular basin with the node parallel to the shore, according to a formula by Fleming. The average speed determined by method ( I ) is small, namely 0.07 knots. The second method, assuming standing wave oscillation gives a value of 0.16 knots. The currents as measured in Types I11 and IV are higher than these values except in the shallow areas.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FGDKQ6KVU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Atkins, 1970, p. 6&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clockwise circulation seems to be the prevalent type in False Bay. Appears to originate from outside the bay - forced by easterly and south easterly winds in the area near Danger Point (near Walker Bay)&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>The land-sea breeze influences the oceanography of the southern Benguela upwelling system at multiple time-scales</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>The physical and biogeochemical functioning of eastern boundary upwelling systems is generally understood within the context of the upwelling - relaxation cycle, driven by sub-diurnal wind variability (i.e. with a time-scale of greater than a day). Here, we employ a realistically configured and validated 3D model of the southern Benguela upwelling system to quantify the impact of super-diurnal winds associated with the land-sea breeze (LSB). The ocean response to the LSB is found to be particularly enhanced within St Helena Bay (SHB), a hotspot for productivity which is also prone to Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) development. We attribute the enhanced response to a combination of near-critical latitude for diurnal-inertial resonance (~32.5°S), the local enhancement of the LSB, and the local development of a shallow stratified surface layer through bay retention. Pronounced advection of the surface layer by diurnal-inertial oscillations contributes to large differences in day- and night-time sea surface temperatures (SST’s) (more than 2°C on average in SHB). Event-scale diapycnal mixing is particularly enhanced within SHB, as highlighted by a numerical experiment initialised with a subsurface passive tracer. These super-diurnal processes are shown to influence sub-diurnal dynamics within SHB through their modulation of the vertical water column structure. A deeper thermocline retains the upwelling front closer to land during active upwelling, while geostrophically-driven alongshore flow is impacted through the modulation of cross-shore pressure gradients. The results suggest that the LSB is likely to play an important role in the productivity and therefore HAB development within SHB, and highlight potential challenges for observational systems and models aiming to improve our understanding of the physical and biological functioning of the system.</dcterms:abstract>

Diapycnal mixing is maximised at the critical latitude of 30°N/S (Zhang et al., 2010; Fearon et al., 2020), driven primarily by the locally forced diurnal-inertial oscillations (which are amplified by the resonance effect), while evanescent first baroclinic mode internal waves play a secondary role (Fearon et al., 2022). It has been suggested that these processes may play an important role in the biological functioning of these systems primarily through the entrainment of nutrient-rich subsurface waters into the surface, thereby enhancing primary productivity (Fawcett et al., 2008; Aguiar-Gonzalez et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2014). It has further been suggested that enhanced vertical mixing driven by the land-sea breeze may impact lower frequency physical processes through its modulation of the vertical water column structure. A deepened thermocline may for instance steepen cross-shore pressure gradients and intensify alongshore flows, as indicated by observations in the Coastal Southern California Bight (Nam and Send, 2013). The 2D numerical experiments of Fearon et al. (2022) suggested that a deepened Ekman boundary layer driven by land-sea breeze forcing near the critical latitude would serve to maintain the upwelling front closer to the land boundary, with a net warming effect on nearshore surface waters. A further implication of the land-sea breeze within the context of EBUS is the role it plays in pronounced horizontal advection of the upwelling front. High amplitude surface oscillations can drive the outcropping and subduction of the upwelling front over the diurnal cycle, a process which has been cited as playing a key role in diurnal temperature variability in a number of in-situ observations in EBUS (Kaplan et al., 2003; Woodson et al., 2007; Bonicelli et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2017). The relative contributions of solar irradiance and wind-driven advection to diurnal variability in sea surface temperatures can however be difficult to separate in site specific observations.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FTJ4J7JXR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2023, p. 2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

North of Cape Columbine, the Goodhope Jet tends to bifurcate due to shelf widening, resulting in offshore and alongshore components (Shannon and Nelson, 1996; Veitch et al., 2018), the latter corresponding to the Columbine Jet which effectively defines a dynamic boundary between the nearshore waters of St Helena Bay and those offshore (Lamont et al., 2015). Also evident in the model is upwelling along a narrow belt on the eastern periphery of the bay and the formation of an inner shelf upwelling front (Jury, 1985; Taunton-Clark, 1985).

&lt;p&gt;If there are cross shore pressure gradients set up on the eastern periphery of false bay, there could be jet currents. I think they might be limited by the shallow depths of the bay.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, the oscillatory nature of the surface currents is clearly evident, whereby the cross-shore component in the surface current is offshore at night, turning to onshore during the day. This phasing is tied to that of the land-sea breeze, indicating they are driven primarily by the diurnal-inertial resonance phenomenon. The surface currents drive the outcropping of the inner shelf upwelling front within St Helena Bay during the night (e.g. refer to the 08:30 time-step), however six hours later the newly upwelled waters are once again subducted by onshore surface currents. These processes contribute to temperature variability of greater than 5°C within the inner shelf regions of St Helena Bay over the considered 24 hour period.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FTJ4J7JXR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2023, p. 9&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected. The super-inertial (higher frequency than the diurnal and inertial effects) variability is associated to the land-sea breeze, which obviously changes throughout a 24 hour period.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Enhanced Vertical Mixing in Coastal Upwelling Systems Driven by Diurnal‐Inertial Resonance: Numerical Experiments</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Abstract
            
              The land‐sea breeze is resonant with the inertial response of the ocean at the critical latitude of 30°N/S. 1‐D vertical numerical experiments were undertaken to study the key drivers of enhanced diapycnal mixing in coastal upwelling systems driven by diurnal‐inertial resonance near the critical latitude. The effect of the land boundary was implicitly included in the model through the “Craig approximation” for first‐order cross‐shore surface elevation gradient response. The model indicates that for shallow water depths (&lt;
              ∼
              100 m), bottom shear stresses must be accounted for in the formulation of the “Craig approximation,” as they serve to enhance the cross‐shore surface elevation gradient response, while reducing shear and mixing at the thermocline. The model was able to predict the observed temperature and current features during an upwelling/mixing event in 60 m water depth in St Helena Bay (
              ∼
              32.5°S, southern Benguela), indicating that the locally forced response to the land‐sea breeze is a key driver of diapycnal mixing over the event. Alignment of the subinertial Ekman transport with the surface inertial oscillation produces shear spikes at the diurnal‐inertial frequency; however their impact on mixing is secondary when compared with the diurnal‐inertial resonance phenomenon. The amplitude of the diurnal anticyclonic rotary component of the wind stress represents a good diagnostic for the prediction of diapycnal mixing due to diurnal‐inertial resonance. The local enhancement of this quantity over St Helena Bay provides strong evidence for the importance of the land‐sea breeze in contributing to primary production in this region through nutrient enrichment of the surface layer.

            Plain Language Summary
            
              Winds near the coast often have a daily cycle known as the land‐sea breeze. Near latitudes of 30°N/S ubiquitous rotating ocean currents also have a daily frequency and therefore become enhanced by daily winds at these latitudes. The ocean currents result in vertical mixing of subsurface and surface water layers, bringing subsurface nutrients to the surface where they stimulate phytoplankton growth. In this study we use a simple model of the ocean (composed of the vertical dimension only) to study the key drivers of vertical mixing due to the land‐sea breeze. We show how vertical mixing is reduced in shallow water (&lt;
              ∼
              100 m) near the coast, where currents are slowed down by friction at the seabed. We find that vertical mixing can be predicted by a parameter computed from wind speed and direction over time. This parameter is shown to be enhanced over St Helena Bay on the west coast of South Africa, where phytoplankton blooms are known to be particularly prevalent. The results suggest that the land‐sea breeze is likely to be an important contributor to phytoplankton bloom development in this region. Similar processes are likely to be at play in other coastal regions.

We find that vertical mixing can be predicted by a parameter computed from wind speed and direction over time. This parameter is shown to be enhanced over St Helena Bay on the west coast of South Africa, where phytoplankton blooms are known to be particularly prevalent. The results suggest that the land‐sea breeze is likely to be an important contributor to phytoplankton bloom development in this region. Similar processes are likely to be at play in other coastal regions.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper seems a bit intense, but this is what I gather from the abstract and plain language summary: Vertical mixing is reduced in shallow water (less than 100 m) due to friction with the bottom. The amplitude of the diurnal anticyclonic rotary component of the wind stress represent (strength of the land sea breeze, and its direction)&amp;nbsp; COULD enhance diapycnal mixing due to diurnal-inertial resonance.&lt;/p&gt;

The land‐sea breeze has however been identified as a mechanism for contributing to nutrient enrichment of the surface layer through diapycnal mixing (Aguiar‐González et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2014). This paper further explores the contribution of the land‐sea breeze to driving vertical mixing and consequent diapycnal nutrient flux in coastal upwelling systems.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diurnal winds are super-inertial winds. This means that the fluctuate with periods shorter than the inertial period of the Earth at a given latitude. They are called superinertial, because their frequency is higher (period shorter) than the inertial period of the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diurnal winds are thought to be of little importance to the understanding of the physical and biogeochemical process in coastal upwelling systems (relative to subinertial winds).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The land-sea breeze has been identified as a mechanism that contributes to nutrient enrichment of surface waters through diapycnal mixing.&lt;/p&gt;

The rotary component refers to inertial oscillations, which can be described as anticyclonic circular motions with a frequency equal to the Coriolis parameter f 1⁄4 2Ωsinφ, where Ω is the angular rotation of the earth and φ is the latitude.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are two components to wind stress. There is a nonrotary component (straight), which drives the Ekman dynamics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also a rotary component which is driven by the rotation of the Earth, and therefore is dependent on the latitude. The rotary component refers to inertial oscillations, which are anticyclonic circular motions with a frequency equal to the Coriolis parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the case of a uniform wind stress, a forcing duration of half the inertial period (less than 1 day at all latitudes by definition) is optimal for imparting energy into the inertial response (Pollard, 1970). The most efficient way of imparting energy into surface mixed layer inertial currents is in the form of an anticyclonically rotating wind stress with a frequency ω equal to the inertial frequency f, as in this case the wind stress and surface current vectors are always aligned (Alford, 2001; D'Asaro, 1985; Pollard &amp;amp; Millard, 1970). Near latitudes of 30°N/S the inertial frequency is diurnal, leading to resonance between the land‐sea breeze and the inertial response, a phenomenon known as diurnal‐inertial resonance (Craig, 1989; Simpson et al., 2002). This implies that even low amplitude diurnal wind variability can give rise to significant amplitude inertial oscillations at these latitudes.” &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%222%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 2&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A uniform wind stress with a duration of half of the inertial period is optimal for imparting energy into the inertial component of surface currents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most efficient way to do this is by having anticylconically rotating wind stress, with a frequency equal to the inertial frequency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Near 30 degrees N/S, the inertial frequency is diurnal: This means that water parcels take roughly one day to complete a full rotation due to the rotation of the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is resonance (superposition and amplitude increasing interaction) between the superinertial land-sea breeze and the inertial response of surface currents to subinertial winds that drive Ekman dynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resonance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the frequency of an external force matches the natural frequency of a system, it can cause the system to oscillate with greater amplitude.&amp;nbsp;In the case of diurnal-inertial resonance, the daily forcing (e.g., sea breeze) matches the inertial frequency at certain latitudes, leading to a significant amplification of inertial oscillations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This implies that variability in the diurnal winds can give rise to significant amplitude inertial oscillations at these latitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

Observations of wind‐driven inertial oscillations in shallow stratified shelf seas have been shown to produce bursts of enhanced shear at the inertial frequency, termed “shear spikes,” which promote vertical mixing and deepening of the thermocline (Burchard &amp;amp; Rippeth, 2009; Lincoln et al., 2016). The analytical shear production theory of Burchard and Rippeth (2009) has been shown to provide a good explanation for these observations. Such “shear spikes” have been further shown to contribute significantly to surface nutrient availability and consequently primary productivity in shelf seas (Williams et al., 2013).

&lt;p&gt;There are bursts of enhanced shear (change of direction and velocity due&amp;nbsp; to acceleration or deceleration) which create turbulence and enhances diapycnal mixing. These bursts of enhanced shear coincide with the inertial frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

Stratification between the surface and subsurface layers restricts the generation of wind‐driven currents to within the surface mixed layer. In the absence of the land boundary effect subsurface currents are not generated. The impact of water depth is therefore negligible in this experiment. The enhancement of the surface inertial oscillation is accompanied by the deepening of the thermocline and the cooling of the surface waters due to the entrainment of subthermocline waters. The simulation indicates a steady enrichment of the surface layer with the subsurface tracer, as evidenced by the increase in Cs over the simulation. The enhanced diapycnal mixing is driven by elevated bulk shear, which is shown to increase rapidly over the first few days of the simulation, peaking at day ∼5, before decreasing thereafter.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 9&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure shows the effect of a land boundary and offshore Ekman transport. The shear spikes are present and two distinct current layers are present. The net effect of the surface current is offshore, and the subsurface current is 180 degrees out of phase (inversely out of phase) with the surface. This shows that the offshore surface transport leads to onshore subsurface transport and diapycnal mixing. The oscillation between the two is diurnal! This means that you get a onshore and offshore component each 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

The onset of enhanced surface currents is accompanied by a deepening of the thermocline and a lowering of surface layer temperatures, consistent with the effects of diapycnal mixing. The model overestimates the deepening of the thermocline; however the net cooling of the surface layer is somewhat contradictorily underestimated. The observations reveal strong diurnal‐inertial variability in surface temperature, particularly over the period 09–12 March, which is not reproduced in the model. The model does include a diurnal signal of surface layer warming due to the heat flux input; however the combination of mixing and heating alone cannot explain the observed diurnal variability. These discrepancies point to the presence of vertical and horizontal advection driven variability in the observations which is not included in the physics of the model. A further important difference between the model and the observations is that the observations include significant vertical displacements of the thermocline (∼5 m amplitude) with a diurnal frequency which are absent in the model. This indicates the presence of near‐inertial internal waves, likely generated by the convergence and divergence of the forced response near the land boundary, which are by definition not included in the physics of the model.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2212%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 12&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

First baroclinic mode internal waves also introduce a 180° phase shift between surface and subsurface layers, which is an important contributor to diapycnal mixing (Xing et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2010). Separating the contribution of the internal wave component from the locally forced response described in this paper is complicated by the similar vertical current structures and frequencies of these processes. The good agreement between observations and the 1‐D vertical model however suggests that diapycnal mixing over the considered event was dominated by resonance between the local diurnal wind variability and the locally generated inertial oscillation, while the propagating near‐inertial internal wave component was of lower importance. Two‐dimensional numerical experiments designed to ascertain the diapycnal mixing contribution of near‐inertial internal waves set up by diurnal‐inertial resonance at a land boundary is a topic of ongoing investigation.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FKLBUZTIR%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2217%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2020, p. 17&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Diurnal wind cycles and upwelling off the northern portion of the Cape Peninsula in summer</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Summer winds along the north-west coast of the Cape Peninsula were investigated to determine their impact on a localized upwelling plume. From automatic weather stations, moored buoys and aerial surveys, a pronounced diurnal cycle in south-easterly wind flow was documented. The orography of the northern portion of the Cape Peninsula is complex, with mountain ridges causing a nocturnal downslope wind jet exceeding 10 m·s−1 during anticyclonic weather conditions. This phenomenon is detailed in three case studies presented. When an inversion layer descended below the top of nearby Table Mountain (1 000 m), a downwind wake developed extending 40 km over the Atlantic Ocean. The wake effectively separated surface upwelling plumes emanating from either side of Cape Town, and it expanded and contracted in sympathy with changes in the horizontal temperature gradient and the inversion layer. A wind-shear line developed at the interface between the downslope jet and the wake with a 24-hour cycle.</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Strong cyclonic wind stress curl: wind driven ocean currents, rotation of the wind stress vector in the clockwise direction (low pressure) in the southern hemisphere. This is associated with coastal upwelling.&lt;/p&gt;

Towards evening the inversion interface descended, as shown in figure lOa, compressing south-easterly flow against the orographic barrier. In this manner an accelerating downslope jet is formed at Oudekraal, triggering intense upwelling activity.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F69YR9AGU%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Jury et al., 1985, p. 10&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Could there be a potential analog to this in the GB area? I am not sure, it seems that the winds there are quite calm.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Sea breeze development under an offshore synoptic wind in the South-Western Cape and implications for the Stellenbosch wine-producing area</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Sea breezes were investigated during the maturation period of wine grapes in the South-Western Cape under particular synoptic wind conditions (onshore for Table Bay and offshore for False Bay). Observations from an automatic weather station network located in the Stellenbosch wine-producing area as well as the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS, non-hydrostatic, parallel, version 4.3) were used. Results showed that two sea breezes developed, one from Table Bay late in the morning, and the other from False Bay later in the afternoon. The coastal low strengthened and deflected the sea breeze from Table Bay towards the south and south-east of the study area, while the offshore large-scale circulation hindered the development of the sea breeze in the opposite direction over False Bay and delayed its movement towards land. The decrease in temperature resulting from the onset of the sea breeze from the Atlantic early in the afternoon could be significant for viticulture, reducing the duration and intensity of high temperature stress on grapevine functioning at the coolest locations.</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Important to remember that sea-breeze circulation requires a large pressure (temperature) gradient to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems that the sea-breeze circulation can only have a large effect if the synoptic conditions are almost absent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>The western Agulhas Bank: circulation, stratification and ecology</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Studies of the physical oceanography of the western Agulhas Bank are reviewed, pointing out the unique position of this shelf region between the eastern boundary Benguela system and the western boundary Agulhas system. New observations from moorings off Quoin Point during summer 1986/87 permit a fuller description of the dynamics of circulation and stratification and the identification of three subregions. The inner shelf is dominated by wind-forcing, as in eastern boundary upwelling systems, whereas the outer shelf is dominated by oceanic forcing, as over western boundary shelves. The mid-shelf is characterized by strong stratification separating near-surface oceanic water from near-bottom upwelling Central Water. A lack of correlation between currents and temperatures in these three subregions of the western Agulhas Bank suggests that they function independently. This synthesis of the physical oceanography, which includes discussion of the hydrodynamic coupling of the western Agulhas Bank with shelf regions to the east and west, leads to a discussion of the importance of circulation and stratification to the anchovy-related ecology of the region. This centres on the availability of food and transport for spawning anchovy Engraulis capensis on the western Agulhas Bank.</dcterms:abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Western Agulhas Bank borders stretches toward Cape Point from a line at Quion Point. The entrance to False Bay is in water shallower than 100 m. This means that it should (according to this paper), have the background effects of whatever is happening in the inner shelf / coastal region. According to this paper, this region is dominated by wind-driven upwelling (forcing) and extents offshore a distance that is scaled by the internal Rossby radius of deformation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rossby radius of deformation: length scale at which rotational effects become as important as buoyancy or gravity wave effects in the evolution of the flow about some disturbance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the ocean the radius varies with latitude. The radius near the equator is larger than 200 km, and in high latitudes it is much smaller, less than 10 km.&amp;nbsp; This then determines the size limit of eddies. The lower the latitude, the larger the eddies and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

There is also no significant cross-shelf correlation between temperatures observed at the three moorings. From a quantitative analysis of the co-varying spatial structures (empirical orthogonal function analysis) which make up the observed current field, it is clear that three orthogonal modes dominate the observed current variance (accounting for 90% of the variance). One mode corresponds to each of the subregions (Largier et al. 1989).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FW6L6HPAF%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22322%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Largier et al., 1992, p. 322&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Towards Rogue Wave Characterization in False Bay, South Africa</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Rogue waves are extreme oceanic waves which exceed twice the significant wave height of the wave record. In False Bay, South Africa, a shallow sea mount called rocky bank was suggested by Shipley (1964) to be the cause for increased wave energy along the eastern periphery of False Bay, where it is not uncommon for coastal users, particularly rock fishermen, to be washed off of the rocky coastline. The shallow bathymetry associated with rocky bank refracts the incoming open ocean swell and is thought to focus the wave energy toward sections of this coastline. This investigation aims to understand which offshore wave conditions could be conducive to rogue wave development along the eastern periphery of False Bay, South Africa. To do so, the phase-averaging spectral wave numerical model SWAN was used to investigate various wave conditions which are known to enter False Bay. The focusing effect which rocky bank supposedly has on the incoming wave energy was investigated by deepening and shallowing rocky bank's depth. This study showed that rocky bank does cause a varying degree of wave focusing which appears to be most dependent on the wave period, with higher wave periods leading to greater extents of refraction. According to this study, the average conditions which impact the south-western coastline of South Africa are conducive to wave focusing by rocky bank and despite the rarity of rogue wave events, coastal users are still affected by them. Calm seas have the ability to mislead users that make use of these dangerous rocky coasts, when the event of a rogue wave in small seas can still be sufficient to wash a person into the sea. A study by de Vos &amp; Rautenbach (2019) suggested that users are at a higher risk, for a variety of coastal activities, during (seemingly) good conditions due to the increased human exposure. Since this study only simulated monochromatic wave conditions, one would expect the results to be significantly different if multiple swell systems were simulated concurrently, as this introduces the possibility of the dispersive focusing mechanism for swells that travel at different speeds and thus increasing the likelihood of a rogue wave. The knowledge acquired from this study is a great step towards understanding the wave climate of False Bay. This information can be used to implement possible warning systems which would hopefully be respected by the community and ultimately lessen the lives lost to extreme waves along False Bay's 'Death coast'.</dcterms:abstract>

The most obvious reason for decreased wave heights in False Bay is attributed to the blocking of wave energy by the Cape Peninsula. Upon closer inspection of the southern most tip of the peninsula is almost a 2 m difference between wave heights observed inside and outside of the bay (Theron et al., 2014). Their figure also shows the discrepancy in wave heights between the eastern (greater wave heights) and western periphery (smaller wave heights) of the bay. It is also along the eastern boundary of False Bay where Shipley (1964) showed evidence for wave focusing and the theorized development of rogue waves to occur.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FHC7WT7CE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%229%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Salonen, 2019, p. 9&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Ocean waves begin to be influenced by the sea floor when the water column depth becomes less than half of the wavelength according to linear wave theory. Spatial focusing is the mechanism whereby variable bathymetry or variable current fields lead to the refraction of ocean waves. In areas where the coastline is irregular, wave energy hot-spots may exist which may be utilized as an energy resource through wave power devices as suggested by Halliday &amp;amp; Dorrell (2004).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FHC7WT7CE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2210%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Salonen, 2019, p. 10&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

A technique suggested by Longuet-Higgins (1974) demonstrates this effect and produces a short group of large waves at a given position in a wave tank. For this technique, a long wave group with linearly decreasing frequency (increasing period) is created. It is known that longer waves travel faster than shorter waves, and therefore the lower frequency waves at the end of the wave train will overtake the higher frequency waves (Touboul et al., 2006). This wave train is known as a chirp.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FHC7WT7CE%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2211%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Salonen, 2019, p. 11&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Thermal Structure and Salinity of False Bay</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Data on temperature and salinity obtained during twenty-six cruises from 1963 to 1966, each covering twenty-eight hydrographic stations are presented. The data are grouped into four zones—the three coastal zones, and one central zone, and the mean temperature and salinity of each zone are tabulated for each season. Surface isotherms and isohalines and four vertical temperature sections for each season are shown. The results are discussed and possible explanations for variations are suggested.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Physical oceanography in False Bay: A review</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Valsbaai is die grootste baai in Suidelike Afrika en grens aan ’n belangrike metropolitaanse gebied. Die baai moet daarom in ’n verskeidenheid ontspannings-, nywerheids-, vissery- en ander behoeftes voorsien. Die oorsig skets kortliks die aanvanklike verkenning van die baai en is verder toegespits op meer resente fisies-oseanografiese navorsing in die baai. ’n Konseptuele meetprogram word voorgestel am sommige leemtes in die huidige kennis aan te vul.</dcterms:abstract>

Weens slegte weer het hy Kaappunt nie op die heenreis gesien nie en iewers verder oos ’n kruis aan die Kaapse suidkus opgerig. Eers tydens sy terugreis het hy die nou welbekende Kaappunt waargeneem. Die volgende skip wat hierdie gebied sou besoek was die van Vasco da Gama wat op 20 November 1497 om Kaappunt gevaar het. Waar Kaappunt as geografiese baken aanvanklik ’n baie prominente wegwyser net vir die heenvaart (ooswaarts) was, het dit met die latere toename in skeepsverkeer ewe belangrik vir die terugvaart (weswaarts) geword. Daar is egter baie gou ontdek dat daar ’n tweede, ewe prominente kaap ongeveer 15 seemyl oos van Kaappunt gelee was (teenswoordig Kaap Hangklip). Onoplettende loodse wat tydens hulle terugvaart hierdie verkeerde of “ vals” kaap vir Kaappunt aangesien het, sou hulle plotseling binne ’n groot baai sonder noordwaartse deurgang bevind. Na aanleiding hiervan is na Kaap Hangklip as Cabo Falso verwys en na die naasliggende baai as Golfo de Falso, of Baaij Falso, en later Valsbaai. Die eerste beskrywing van hierdie baai is in 1503 deur Antonio de Saldanha gegee en ’n paar jaar later verskyn die benaming ook op wereldkaarte.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2F7X992TYK%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%22133%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Gründlingh and Largier, 1988, p. 133&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inertial period:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time that it takes a fluid parcel to complete one inertial oscillation. The inertial period is calculated as 2pi/f. The inertial period increases towards infinity near the equator. The inertial period of False Bay is around 24 hours. This gives us a diurnal inertial period/frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subinertial winds:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind fluctuations with periods longer (frequency lower, hence &lt;strong&gt;sub&lt;/strong&gt;inertial) than the inertial period. Near false bay, these would be the prevailing southerly winds that are forced to south easterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isopycnal and Diapycnal Mixing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isopycnal&lt;/strong&gt; mixing refers to the movement of water masses along isopycnals. It is typically caused by lateral diffusion or advection, and redistributes water properties in the same density layer. This mixes water masses with the same density, the product of which would have the mixture of the temperatures, salinities, and biogeochemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diapycnal&lt;/strong&gt; mixing refers to the movement of water masses across isopycnals. It is typically caused by eddies, internal waves and other turbulent processes. Upwelling is an example: The water is brought up and its density changes. This can affect stratification and circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind components:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are two components to wind stress. There is a &lt;strong&gt;nonrotary&lt;/strong&gt; component (straight), which drives the Ekman dynamics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;strong&gt;rotary&lt;/strong&gt; component which is driven by the rotation of the Earth, and therefore is dependent on the latitude. The rotary component refers to inertial oscillations, which are anticyclonic circular motions with a frequency equal to the Coriolis parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barotropic and Baroclinic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both describe the vertical structure of a fluid. Barotropic fluids/conditions are when pressure is the only determinant of density. Baroclinic is when density is determined by the combination of temperature and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;First-Order Response:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;When a force is applied to a barotropic fluid, it initially reacts in a simple way.&amp;nbsp;This initial reaction is considered the first-order response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;For example, wind stress on the ocean surface will cause the surface water to move in the direction of the wind.&amp;nbsp;This initial movement is the first-order barotropic response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;Higher-order responses might involve the development of currents and eddies as the initial response propagates and interacts with other factors like the Earth's rotation and coastline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal waves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbances that propagate due to buoyancy forces, rather than surface gravity waves. Internal waves occur when a water parcel in a stratified fluid is displaced, causing it to oscillate due to buoyancy differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first baroclinic mode is the simplest mode (vertical structure). It is a displacement of the pycnocline (thermocline) up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;Resonance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(84, 93, 126)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;When the frequency of an external force matches the natural frequency of a system, it can cause the system to oscillate with greater amplitude.&amp;nbsp;In the case of diurnal-inertial resonance, the daily forcing (e.g., sea breeze) matches the inertial frequency at certain latitudes, leading to a significant amplification of inertial oscillations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;Internal Rossby Radius of Deformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 29, 53)&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;It represents the characteristic distance over which rotation significantly influences fluid motion, specifically in stratified fluids like the ocean and atmosphere, where density differences create buoyancy effects.&amp;nbsp;Essentially, it's the distance over which an object will move before Earth's rotation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)&quot;&gt;significantly deflects its path, causing it to turn rather than move in a straight line.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>Using Project Loon Superpressure Balloon Observations to Investigate the Inertial Peak in the Intrinsic Wind Spectrum in the Midlatitude Stratosphere</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Location information from superpressure balloons flown by Project Loon provide an unprecedented opportunity to analyze wind fields in the midlatitude stratosphere. Horizontal velocity spectra from the balloons' quasi-intrinsic frame of reference show clear evidence of a persistent peak in the intrinsic wind spectrum around the inertial frequency. In the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes, peak-to-peak amplitudes of horizontal velocity perturbations (on the order of 20 m/s) are larger than those seen in previous superpressure balloon campaigns in polar regions and similar to those observed in vertical soundings in the midlatitudes. A rotary spectral analysis shows that near-circular anticyclonic rotation of horizontal wind perturbations around the inertial frequency dominate at most times and locations. The strongest anticyclonic rotation is more common in balloon flight segments with weak zonal winds and during the austral summer. Flight segments with strong eastward zonal velocities during austral winter and spring are more likely to have mixed cyclonic and anticyclonic power around the inertial frequency. These results confirm previous model and radiosonde observations of the peak in horizontal kinetic energy at the inertial frequency and demonstrate they are associated with increased anticyclonic wave power indicative of near-inertial oscillations or inertia-gravity waves. Flight segments with mixed cyclonic and anticyclonic power around the inertial frequency display a continuum of wave power from planetary to gravity wave scales. These results help explain the divergence of actual and modeled balloon trajectories in previous studies and provide a baseline against which reanalysis or meteorological model realizations of the intrinsic velocity field can be assessed.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Surf Zone Currents</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>A large fraction of the water-wave energy incident on beaches is dissipated as the waves break and travel towards the shore through the surf zone. However, the momentum associated with the incident waves is not destroyed and drives other motions within the surf zone. An analysis is given of the unsteady and irregular currents that may occur in the surf zone. The forcing due to a discrete group of waves, and the vorticity of the surf-zone currents are the major topics. In particular, the almost two-dimensional nature of the flow implies that significant eddies are likely to be generated. There is evidence that eddies arise from long-shore currents, and the combination of eddies of opposite sign gives rip currents. It is noted that generation of vorticity by non-uniformities in bores may be a useful way of considering the forcing of surf zone motion. Expressions for the rate of increase in the circulation about material circuits and the vorticity generated at bores are derived.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The influence of a spatially varying wind field on the circulation and thermal structure of False Bay during summer: a numerical modelling study</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>False Bay is South Africa’s largest bay and is situated adjacent to a major urban centre. The study of its physical processes is relevant to the monitoring and management of pollution, as well as to its utility for recreation, tourism, fishing and naval operations. Yet very few modelling studies have been conducted to date, and the exact nature of the bay’s dynamics has yet to be fully elucidated.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>The influence of the land–sea breeze on coastal upwelling systems: locally forced vs internal wave vertical mixing and implications for thermal fronts</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Land–sea breeze forcing near a land boundary drives both a locally forced response and an associated offshore propagating internal wave response, the effects of which can be difficult to separate. These processes enhance vertical mixing near the critical latitude for diurnal-inertial resonance (30° N/S), and are a feature of all four major eastern boundary upwelling systems. Here, we employ 1D- and 2D-vertical model configurations forced by a land–sea breeze to quantify the relative contributions of the locally forced and internal wave responses to surface currents and vertical mixing, and test sensitivity to latitude and bottom slope. We further include a sub-inertial alongshore wind to consider the role of the land–sea breeze in the context of upwelling systems. At the critical latitude, the internal waves generated via thermocline pumping near the land boundary are evanescent (in agreement with theory) and largely absent ∼50 km offshore. The internal waves are shown to contribute to vertical mixing, which can be ∼20% greater than that due to the forced response alone, further deepening the surface Ekman boundary layer. This deepening reduces the sub-inertial offshore advection of surface waters, thereby retaining the upwelling front closer to the land boundary and driving a net warming of the nearshore surface waters. Cross-shore horizontal oscillations of the upwelling front generated by the land–sea breeze drive strong diurnal variability in sea surface temperature, in agreement with observations from a cross-shore mooring array in the southern Benguela (∼32.3° S).</dcterms:abstract>

These processes enhance vertical mixing near the critical latitude for diurnal-inertial resonance (30◦ N/S), and are a feature of all four major eastern boundary upwelling systems. Here, we employ 1D- and 2D-vertical model configurations forced by a land–sea breeze to quantify the relative contributions of the locally forced and internal wave responses to surface currents and vertical mixing, and test sensitivity to latitude and bottom slope. We further include a sub-inertial alongshore wind to consider the role of the land–sea breeze in the context of upwelling systems. At the critical latitude, the internal waves generated via thermocline pumping near the land boundary are evanescent (in agreement with theory) and largely absent ∼50 km offshore. The internal waves are shown to contribute to vertical mixing, which can be ∼20% greater than that due to the forced response alone, further deepening the surface Ekman boundary layer. This deepening reduces the sub-inertial offshore advection of surface waters, thereby retaining the upwelling front closer to the land boundary and driving a net warming of the nearshore surface waters. Cross-shore horizontal oscillations of the upwelling front generated by the land–sea breeze drive strong diurnal variability in sea surface temperature, in agreement with observations from a cross-shore mooring array in the southern Benguela (∼32.3◦ S).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FF86F8TQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%221%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2022, p. 1&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locally forced response being the superposition of the local wind-driven surface mixed layer response and the opposing first order barotropic response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First-Order Response:&lt;br&gt;When a force is applied to a barotropic fluid, it initially reacts in a simple way.&amp;nbsp;This initial reaction is considered the first-order response.For example, wind stress on the ocean surface will cause the surface water to move in the direction of the wind.&amp;nbsp;This initial movement is the first-order barotropic response.Higher-order responses might involve the development of currents and eddies as the initial response propagates and interacts with other factors like the Earth's rotation and coastline.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, in close proximity to the land boundary, horizontal gradients in cross-shore currents are high and the non-linear advection terms become important. Onshore (offshore) surface currents lead to convergence (divergence) and the downward (upward) displacement of the thermocline. The forced thermocline displacements have a diurnal periodicity, consistent with the diurnal periodicity of the wind forcing. Unlike at 50 km offshore, the results at 10 km offshore reveal diurnal variability in surface temperature and surface tracer concentrations (Fig. 3b), reflecting the advection of horizontal gradients which are set up by high spatial variability in diapycnal mixing. The amplitude of the surface inertial oscillations is significantly weaker at 10 km offshore than at 50 km offshore (Fig. 3c), implying reduced vertical shear and therefore reduced diapycnal mixing, as reflected in the surface tracer concentration (Fig. 3d). We note that although the alongshore current velocity data are not plotted, the oscillatory nature of the currents dictates a very similar vertical structure in the alongshore currents, the only notable difference being a 6 h phase shift when compared to the cross-shore currents.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FF86F8TQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2022, p. 6&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of diurnal-inertial resonance decreases as you get closer to shore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Onshore surface currents cause convergence and the downward displacement of the thermocline. Offshore surface currents lead to divergence and the upward displacement of the thermocline. The forced thremocline displacements have a diurnal frequency because they are linked to the land-sea breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

Between 10 km and 50 km offshore, diapycnal mixing is shown to respond to a combination of the forced response and the internal wave response, generating diurnal peaks of enhanced mixing at the diagnostic thermocline (Fig. 4b). The net result is an enhancement of the cumulative diapycnal mixing over and above that induced by the forced response alone, as revealed by a locally enhanced passive tracer concentration in the surface layer of the model (Fig. 4c).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FF86F8TQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%226%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2022, p. 6&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical displacements of the thermocline are greatest at the land-sea boundary, but the water is strongly stratified, so little vertical mixing takes place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between 10 and 50 km offshore, diapycnal mixing (vertical mixing) responds to a combination of the forced response and the internal wave response.

(2)), while the offshore propagation of the forced displacement is latitudinally dependent. At 20◦S, the diurnal pumping of the thermocline results in offshore propagating internal waves, however these waves are evanescent at latitudes of 30◦S and 40◦S. Eq. (1) dictates that waves can only freely propagate at latitudes where the inertial frequency f is less than the frequency of the forced diurnal displacements (i.e. equatorward of 30◦ N/S, such that f &amp;lt; ω).”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FF86F8TQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%227%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2022, p. 7&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equatorward of 30 degrees N/S, internal waves can propagate freely. This is because the inertial frequency is much lower (period reaches infinity at the equator) than the diurnal displacements of the thermocline. Therefore the internal waves generated by pumping the thermocline are not affected by the rotation of the earth as much, and they can maintain stratification.&lt;/p&gt;

As the slope becomes steeper, so the convergence/divergence in the forced response becomes greater and the effects of the internal waves become apparent.

&lt;p&gt;It becomes more complicated. Ekman dynamics are driven by subinerital winds (winds with a lower frequency than the inertial frequency, at a given latitude). These winds are synoptic, or have have a period of more than a day. In this case, they can be thought of as the alongshore, southerly winds.&lt;/p&gt;

As offshore Ekman transport is the same in both Fig. 11b and c, volume conservation dictates that D1L1 = D2L2, and therefore the landward offset of the upwelling front will scale linearly with the increased depth in the surface Ekman boundary layer. For example, if a mean alongshore wind drives a 15 m deep Ekman boundary layer 10 km offshore, the same wind will drive a 20 m deep Ekman boundary layer 7.5 km offshore (15÷20 × 10). Shallower surface mixed layers elicit higher amplitude oscillations in the surface layer and greater mixing (Fearon et al., 2020), implying that regions prone to the development of shallow surface layers, such as retention zones in the lee of capes (e.g. Graham and Largier, 1997; Oliveira et al., 2009), are likely to be most affected by this process.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FF86F8TQG%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2213%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Fearon et al., 2022, p. 13&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:title>A synthesis of three decades of socio-ecological change in False Bay, South Africa: setting the scene for multidisciplinary research and management</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Over the past three decades, marine resource management has shifted conceptually from top-down sectoral approaches towards the more systems-oriented multi-stakeholder frameworks of integrated coastal management and ecosystem-based conservation. However, the successful implementation of such frameworks is commonly hindered by a lack of cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer, especially between natural and social sciences. This review represents a holistic synthesis of three decades of change in the oceanography, biology and human dimension of False Bay, South Africa. The productivity of marine life in this bay and its close vicinity to the steadily growing metropolis of Cape Town have led to its socio-economic significance throughout history. Considerable research has highlighted shifts driven by climate change, human population growth, serial overfishing, and coastal development. Upwelling-inducing winds have increased in the region, leading to cooling and likely to nutrient enrichment of the bay. Subsequently the distributions of key components of the marine ecosystem have shifted eastward, including kelp, rock lobsters, seabirds, pelagic fish, and several alien invasive species. Increasing sea level and exposure to storm surges contribute to coastal erosion of the sandy shorelines in the bay, causing losses in coastal infrastructure and posing risk to coastal developments. Since the 1980s, the human population of Cape Town has doubled, and with it pollution has amplified. Overfishing has led to drastic declines in the catches of numerous commercially and recreationally targeted fish, and illegal fishing is widespread. The tourism value of the bay contributes substantially to the country’s economy, and whale watching, shark-cage diving and water sports have become important sources of revenue. Compliance with fisheries and environmental regulations would benefit from a systems-oriented approach whereby coastal systems are managed holistically, embracing both social and ecological goals. In this context, we synthesize knowledge and provide recommendations for multidisciplinary research and monitoring to achieve a better balance between developmental and environmental agendas.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>A wave-driven surface circulation feature in Table Bay</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Table Bay, located in the Cape Peninsula region of South Africa, supports a variety of human and ecological interests. Notably it hosts a major port, with significant shipping and smaller maritime activity in and near the bay. Despite this, knowledge of its circulation dynamics remains cursory. In this study, surface gravity waves, particularly those with longer periods and higher wave heights such as swells, are shown to be important in driving near surface currents and establishing circulation patterns within Table Bay. A surface circulation feature, linked to large wave conditions and established by strong wave-driven flows near Robben Island, is identified and described by means of two coastal ocean model simulations. One simulation is dynamically coupled to a wave model and includes current forcing due to waves, whereas the other neglects waves. The influence of these wave-driven currents is relevant at the event scale, but also affects the monthly means of the simulation periods. Finally, the importance of including accurate surface gravity wave forcing in simulations of coastal currents, for applications of coastal models, is elucidated. This is achieved by analysing differences in the drift of a series of drogues deployed in the coupled and uncoupled simulations. Trajectories, drift speeds and drogue fates differed materially between the two configurations, underscoring the implications of wave-driven currents for common use cases.</dcterms:abstract>

The occurrence of this feature in the model provides further motivation for enhanced observational capacity in this important embayment. The results of a simple drift experiment using virtual drogues underscore the importance of including surface gravity wave forcing in all simulations of the circulation within Table Bay. In particular, modelling of currents for applications such as trajectory modelling for search and rescue are likely to be materially deficient in the absence of an appropriate handling of the contribution of waves to the Eulerian flow.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;citation&quot; data-citation=&quot;%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F14070386%2Fitems%2FLSV9THP8%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2216%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;citation-item&quot;&gt;Vos et al., 2023, p. 16&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
